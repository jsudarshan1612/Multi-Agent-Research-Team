# 🧠 Autonomous Multi-Agent Research Intelligence System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an advanced AI system where multiple intelligent agents collaborate to perform automated research, validation, synthesis, and report generation.

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system uses a self-correcting multi-agent architecture with memory and dynamic role allocation.

---

## 🚀 Core Features
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Autonomous research agent
- Critic agent for validation
- Synthesizer agent for knowledge fusion
- Writer agent for final reports
- Self-improving memory system
- Dynamic agent role switching

---

## 🧠 Agent Roles
| Agent | Function |
|------|---------|
| Research Agent | Collects information |
| Critic Agent | Validates accuracy |
| Synthesizer Agent | Combines data |
| Writer Agent | Generates report |
| Memory Manager | Stores knowledge |

---

## 🏗️ System Workflow
1. User submits a query
2. Research agent gathers data
3. Critic agent validates sources
4. Synthesizer merges findings
5. Writer produces final report
