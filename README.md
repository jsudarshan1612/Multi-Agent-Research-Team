## 📌 Project Overview
The **Autonomous Multi-Agent Research Intelligence System** is an advanced AI platform where multiple intelligent agents collaborate, critique, synthesize, and generate high-quality research outputs.

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system uses a **self-correcting, memory-driven multi-agent architecture** that adapts its research strategy over time.

---

## 🚀 Core Features
- 🧠 Multi-agent collaboration system
- 🔍 Autonomous research agent
- 🛡️ Critic agent for fact validation
- 🔗 Synthesizer agent for knowledge fusion
- ✍️ Writer agent for structured reports
- 🧾 Long-term and short-term agent memory
- 🔄 Self-correcting research cycles
- ⚙️ Dynamic role allocation between agents

## 🧠 Intelligent Agent Roles

| Agent | Function |
|------|---------|
| Research Agent | Collects relevant data from sources |
| Critic Agent | Validates accuracy and reliability |
| Synthesizer Agent | Combines and structures information |
| Writer Agent | Generates final research report |
| Memory Manager | Stores and retrieves past knowledge |
