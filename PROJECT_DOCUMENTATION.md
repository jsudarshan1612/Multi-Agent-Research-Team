1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming how research, data analysis, and decision-making are performed. Traditional research processes are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency.

This project presents an Autonomous Multi-Agent Research Intelligence System where multiple AI agents collaborate to perform research tasks automatically. Each agent has a specialized role, forming a virtual research team.

2. Problem Statement

Conventional chatbots and research tools have several limitations:

Single-model architecture without collaboration

Lack of validation leads to inaccurate outputs

No memory or learning from previous tasks

Limited ability to handle complex research queries

This project addresses these issues by implementing a collaborative, memory-driven, and self-correcting multi-agent system.

3. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

Design a multi-agent AI architecture.

Automate research and report generation.

Implement agent collaboration and communication.

Introduce memory-based learning.

Create a scalable and intelligent research assistant.

4. System Architecture
Core Agents

The system consists of multiple specialized agents:

Task Manager Agent

Receives user queries.

Assigns tasks to agents.

Research Agent

Collects relevant information.

Critic Agent

Validates accuracy and reliability.

Synthesizer Agent

Combines and structures data.

Writer Agent

Generates final research report.

Memory Manager

Stores previous results.

Improves future outputs.

5. System Workflow

User submits a research query.

Task Manager distributes the task.

Research Agent gathers data.

Critic Agent validates sources.

Synthesizer merges findings.

Writer generates final report.

Memory Manager stores knowledge.
