## 1. Introduction
This project presents an Autonomous Multi-Agent Research Intelligence System where multiple AI agents collaborate to perform research tasks automatically. Each agent has a specialized role, forming a virtual research team.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional research tools and chatbots have limitations:
- Single-agent architecture
- Lack of validation
- No memory of past tasks
- Limited handling of complex queries

This project solves these issues using a collaborative, memory-driven multi-agent system.

---

## 3. Objectives
- Build a multi-agent AI architecture
- Automate research workflows
- Improve accuracy using validation
- Implement memory-based learning
- Generate structured reports

---

## 4. System Architecture

### Core Agents
1. Task Manager Agent
2. Research Agent
3. Critic Agent
4. Synthesizer Agent
